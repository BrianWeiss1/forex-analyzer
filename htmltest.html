Serving as Mayor of Denver, Governor of Colorado and now as a US Senator, he has proven his abilities in politics. He enjoys high approval ratings amoung minorities, especially Asian Americans. Yu-Min also won't have to worry about fundraising, the DNC has that taken care of. However, with the 2024 MAGA revolution, established politicians are viewed in less of a kind light, and Yu-Min will have a hard time appearing relatable to the general public. Yu-Min will also have to defend himself on a number of fronts, including his controversial crime policies and radical views of foreign policy. <p>Cho can really take this campaign in a number of ways to get ahead of Decker. He could moderate his image and focus on traditional Democrat policies, or he could double down on his unorthodox broad spectrum positions, and try to form a fringe coalition against Decker´s moderate coalition. Either way Cho starts at a slight disadvantage despite Decker being the incumbent party.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>","color_hex":"#4c4ce1","secondary_color_hex":#a1a1ff,"is_active":1,"image_url":"https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&ik=da5b1f2a30&attid=0.1&permmsgid=msg-a:r-3327827839488177624&th=18af793b86278e94&view=fimg&fur=ip&sz=s0-l75-ft&attbid=ANGjdJ8RHqAY9-4rNYvDonuUaGkTybTk_x0bwEcTzFhPPXxXM0xTyL6DnxAHMg478wzuwsxu93ls5CiWjpp-Tg_vZGr-X2R9LFEy2KInu20m_ClSZ2tdR9v1NXpyxFw&disp=emb&realattid=ii_lnavcrdz0","electoral_victory_message":"<h3>REAL PATRIOT DUMMY EXAMPLE SWEEPS</h3>","electoral_loss_message":"<h3>Fake News?</h3>","no_electoral_majority_message":"<h3>DUMMY EXAMPLE RETURNS TO HELL</h3>","description_as_running_mate":null,"candidate_score":1,"running_mate":false,"scrollable":true}},{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":300,"fields":{"first_name":"Brady","last_name":"Decker","election":20,"party":"Republican","state":"Pennsylvania ","priority":1,"description":"Brady Decker has shook the political world, in more ways than one.
